\title{Define Random Intercepts for the Dynamite Model.}
\usage{
random(responses = NULL, correlated = TRUE, noncentered = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{responses}{[\code{character()}]\cr Names of the responses for which the
random intercepts should be defined. Default is all responses defined with
\code{obs}, except categorical response, which does not (yet) support random
intercepts.}

\item{correlated}{[\code{logical(1)}]\cr If \code{TRUE} (the default), correlations of
intercepts within a group (i.e., between responses) are modeled so that
the intercepts follow a multivariate normal distribution.}

\item{noncentered}{[\code{logical(1)}]\cr If \code{TRUE} (the default), use a
noncentered parameterization for random intercepts. Try changing this if
you encounter divergences or other problems in sampling.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{random}.
}
\description{
This function can be used as part of \code{\link[=dynamiteformula]{dynamiteformula()}} to define
(correlated) random intercepts for each group.
}
\details{
With a large number of time points these intercepts can become challenging
sample with default priors. This is because with large group sizes the
group-level intercepts tend to be behave similarly to fixed group-factor
variable so the model becomes overparameterized given these and the common
intercept term. Another potential cause for sampling problems is relatively
large variation in the intercepts (large sigma_nu) compared to the sampling
variation (sigma) in the Gaussian case.
