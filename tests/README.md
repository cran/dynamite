### Running extended tests

The testthat directory contains several long-running tests which are not run by 
default. Running all of these tests can take several 
hours on an ordinary laptop. These tests can be switched on by defining an 
environmental variable `DYNAMITE_EXTENDED_TESTS = "true"` (e.g., 
`Sys.setenv("DYNAMITE_EXTENDED_TESTS" = "true")` in R), and on GitHub Actions by 
adding `run-extended` to the commit message.

These extended tests also depend on additional R packages `plm` and `seqHMM` 
which are not installed automatically when installing `dynamite`.
