# Introduction

Panel data is common in various fields such as social sciences. 
These data consists of multiple subjects, followed over several time points, 
and there are often many observations per individual at each time, for example 
family status and income of each individual at each time point of interest.
Such data can be analyzed in various ways, depending on the research questions 
and the characteristics of the data such as the number of individuals and time 
points, and the assumed distribution of the response variables. Popular, 
somewhat overlapping modelling approaches include dynamic panel models, 
fixed effect models, cross-lagged panel models (CLPM), CLPM with fixed or 
random effects [@arellano1991, @Allison2009, @Bollen2010,
@Allison2017, @Hamaker2015, @Mulder2021]. Parameter estimation is typically 
based on ordinary least squares, generalized method of moments or maximum 
likelihood using structural equation models.

There are several R [@R] packages in CRAN focusing on panel data analysis. 
`plm` [@plm] provides various estimation methods and tests for linear panel 
data model, while `fixest` [@fixest] supports multiple fixed effects and 
different distributions of response variables (based on `stats::family`). 
`panelr` [@panelr] contains tools for panel data manipulation and estimation 
methods for "within-between" models which combine fixed effect and random 
effect models. This is done by using `lme4` [@lme4], `geepack` [@geepack], 
and `brms` [@brms] packages as a backend. Finally, the `lavaan` [@lavaan] 
package provides methods for general structural equation modelling, and thus 
can be used to estimate various panel data models such as cross-lagged panel
models with fixed or random intercepts.

In traditional panel data models such as the ones provided by the 
aforementioned packages, the number of time points considered is often assumed 
to be relatively small, say less than 10, while the number of individuals can 
be for example hundreds or thousands. Due to the small number of time points, 
the effects of predictors are typically assumed to be time-invariant (although 
some extensions to time-varying effects have emerged [@hayakawa2019]). On the 
other hand, when the number of time points is moderate or large, say hundreds 
or thousands, it can be reasonable to assume that the dynamics of the system 
change over time. There are various methods to model time-varying effects in 
(generalized) linear models based on state space models 
[@harvey1982; @durbin2012], with various R implementations 
[@helske2022; @knaus2021; @brodersen2014]. The state space modelling 
approaches are highly flexible but often computationally demanding due to 
assumed latent processes for the regression coefficients and an analytically 
intractable marginal likelihood, so they are most useful in settings with only 
few subjects. Methods based on the varying coefficients models 
[@hastie1993; @eubank2004] can be computationally more convenient, especially 
when the varying coefficients are based on splines. Some of the R 
implementations of time-varying coefficient models include 
[@casas2019; @dziak2021].

The `dynamite` package provides an alternative approach to panel data inference 
which avoids some of the limitations and drawbacks of the aforementioned 
methods. First, `dynamite` supports estimating effects which vary smoothly over 
time according to splines, with penalization based on random walk priors. 
This allows modelling for example effects of interventions which increase or 
decrease over time. Second, `dynamite` supports wide variety of distributions 
for the response variables such as categorical distribution commonly 
encountered in life-course research [@Helske2018]. Third, estimation is done in 
a fully Bayesian fashion using `Stan` [@Stan; @rstan], which leads to 
transparent and interpretable quantification of parameter and predictive 
uncertainty. Finally, with `dynamite` we can model arbitrary number of 
measurements per individual (i.e. multiple channels following [@seqHMM]). 
Jointly modelling all endogenous variables allows us to consider long-term 
effects of interventions which take into account the interdependency of several 
variables of the model, and allows realistic simulation of complex 
counterfactual scenarios.
  
# The Model

Consider an individual $i$ with observations 
$y_{i,t} = (y^1_{i,t}, \ldots, y^c_{i,t},\ldots, y^C_{i,t})$, $t=1,\ldots,T$, 
$i = 1,\ldots,N$ i.e. at each time point $t$ we have $C$ observations from $N$ 
individuals. Assume that each element of $y_{i,t}$ can depend on the past 
values $y_{i,t-1}$, as well as additional exogenous covariates $x_{i,t}$. 
Then, assuming that the elements of $y_{i,t}$ are independent given 
$y_{i, t-1}$ and $x_{i,t}$, we have
\[
\begin{aligned}
  y_{i,t} &\sim p_t(y_{i,t} | y_{i,t-1},x_{i,t}) = 
    \prod_{c=1}^C p^c_t(y^c_{i,t} | y^1_{i,t-1}, \ldots, y^C_{i,t-1}, x_{i,t}).
\end{aligned}
\]
Here the parameters of the conditional distributions $p^c$ depend on time, 
which allows us to take into account the fact that the dynamics of our system 
can evolve over time. 

For $p^c_t$, given a suitable link function depending on our distributional 
assumptions, we define a linear predictor $\eta^c_{i,t}$ for the channel $c$ 
with a following general form:
\[
\begin{aligned}
  \eta^c_{i,t} &= 
    \nu_{i} + \alpha^c_{t} + Z^c_{i,t} \beta^c + X^c_{i,t} \delta^c_{t}
\end{aligned}
\]
$\nu_{i}$ is the individual-specific random intercept, $\alpha_t$ 
(possibly time-varying) is the common intercept term, $Z^c_{i,t}$ defines the 
predictors corresponding to the vector of time-invariant coefficients 
$\beta^c$, and similarly for the time-varying part $X^c_{i,t} \delta^c_{t}$. 
The random intercept terms $\nu_{i}$ are assumed to follow zero-mean Gaussian 
and these can be correlated across channels. Note that dynamite does not center 
the response nor predictor variables.

For time-varying coefficients $\delta$ (and similarly for $\alpha$), 
we use Bayesian P-splines (penalized B-splines) [@lang2004] where
\[
  \delta^c_{k,t} = B_t \omega_k^c, \quad k=1,\ldots,K,
\]
where $K$ is the number of covariates, $B_t$ is a vector of B-spline values at 
time $t$ and $\omega_k^c$ is vector of corresponding spline coefficients. In 
general the number of B-splines $D$ used for constructing the splines for the 
study period $1,\ldots,T$ can be chosen freely, but too large $D$ can result in 
overfitting. To mitigate this, we define a random walk prior for $\omega^c_k$ as
\[
  \omega^c_{k,1} \sim p(\omega^c_{k,1}), \quad
  \omega^c_{k,d} \sim N(\omega^c_{k,d-1}, (\tau^c_k)^2), \quad d=2, \ldots, D.
\]
with user defined prior $p(\omega^c_{k,1})$ on the first coefficient, which due 
to the structure of $B_1$ corresponds to the prior on the $\delta^c_{k,1}$. 
Here, the parameter $\tau^c_k$ controls the smoothness of the spline curves.

# Defining The Model

The models in the `dynamite` package are defined by combining the 
channel-specific formulas defined via the function `dynamiteformula` for which 
a shorthand alias `obs` is available. The function `obs` takes two arguments: 
`formula` and `family`, which define how the response variable of the channel 
depends on the predictor variables in the standard R formula syntax and the 
family of the response variable, respectively. These channel specific 
definitions are then combined into a single model with `+`. For example, 
the following formula 

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
obs(y ~ lag(x), family = "gaussian") + 
obs(x ~ z, family = "poisson")
``` 

defines a model with two channels; first we declare that `y` is a gaussian 
variable depending on the previous value of `x` (`lag(x)`) and then we add a 
second channel declaring `x` as Poisson distributed depending on some exogenous 
variable `z` (for which we do not define any distribution). Note that the model 
formula can be defined without any reference to some external data, just as an 
R formula can. Currently the `dynamite` package supports the following 
distributions for the observations:

* Categorical: `categorical` (with a softmax link using the first  category 
  as reference). See the documentation of the `categorical_logit_glm` in the 
  Stan function reference manual (https://mc-stan.org/users/documentation/).
* Gaussian: `gaussian` (identity link, parameterized using mean 
  and standard deviation).
* Poisson: `poisson` (log-link, with an optional known offset variable).
* Negative-binomial: `negbin` (log-link, using mean and dispersion 
  parameterization, with an optional known offset variable). 
  See the documentation on `NegBinomial2` in the Stan function reference manual.
* Bernoulli: `bernoulli` (logit-link).
* Binomial: `binomial` (logit-link).
* Exponential: `exponential` (log-link).
* Gamma: `gamma` (log-link, using mean and shape parameterization).
* Beta: `beta` (logit-link, using mean and precision parameterization).

## Lagged responses and predictors

The `dynamite` models do not support contemporaneous dependencies in order to 
avoid complex cyclic dependencies which would make handling missing data, 
subsequent predictions, and causal inference challenging or impossible. 
In other words, response variables can only depend on the previous values of 
other response variables. This is why we used `lag(x)` in the previous example, 
a shorthand for `lag(x, k = 1)`, which defines a one-step lag of the variable 
`x`. Longer lags can also be defined by adjusting the argument `k`. 

A special model component `lags` can also be used to quickly add lagged 
responses as predictors. This component adds a lagged value of each response 
in the model as a predictor to every channel. For example, calling 

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
obs(y ~ z, family = "gaussian") + 
obs(x ~ z, family = "poisson") +
lags(k = 1)
``` 

would add `lag(y, k = 1)` as a predictor of `x` and conversely, `lag(x, k = 1)` 
as a predictor of `y`. Therefore, the previous code would produce the exact 
same model as writing

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
obs(y ~ z + lag(x, k = 1), family = "gaussian") + 
obs(x ~ z + lag(y, k = 1), family = "poisson")
```

Just as with the function `lag()`, the argument `k` in `lags` can be adjusted 
to add longer lags of each response to each channel, but for `lags` it can also 
be a vector. The inclusion of lagged response variables in the model implies 
that some time points have to be considered fixed in the estimation. The number 
of fixed time points in the model is equal to the largest shift value of any 
observed response variable in the model (defined either via `lag` or the 
global `lags`).

## Time-varying and time-invariant predictors

The formula within `obs` can also contain an additional special function 
`varying`, which defines the time-varying part of the model equation, in which 
case we could write for example 
`obs(x ~ z + varying(~ -1 + w), family = "poisson")`, which defines a model 
equation with a constant intercept and time-invariant effect of `z`, and a 
time-varying effect of `w`. We also remove the duplicate intercept with `-1` 
in order to avoid identifiability issues in the model estimation (we could also 
define a time varying intercept, in which case we would write 
`obs(x ~ -1 + z + varying(~ w), family = "poisson)`). The part of the formula 
not wrapped with `varying` is assumed to correspond to the fixed part of the 
model, so `obs(x ~ z + varying(~ -1 + w), family = "poisson")` is actually 
identical to `obs(x ~ -1 + fixed(~ z) + varying(~ -1 + w), family = "poisson")` 
and `obs(x ~ fixed(~ z) + varying(~ -1 + w), family = "poisson")`. 
The use of `fixed` is therefore optional.

When defining varying effects, we also need to define how the these 
time-varying regression coefficient behave. For this, a `splines` component 
should be added to the model, e.g. 
`obs(x ~ varying(~ -1 + w), family = "poisson) + splines(df = 10)` 
defines a cubic B-spline with 10 degrees of freedom for the time-varying 
coefficient corresponding to the `w`. If the model contains multiple 
time-varying coefficients, same spline basis is used for all coefficients, 
with unique spline coefficients and their standard deviation, 
as defined in the previous Section.

## Random intercepts

Defining the random intercept term for each group ca be done using 
component `random` where the first argument defines for which channels the 
intercept should be added, and second argument defines whether or not these 
intercepts should be correlated between channels. This leads to a model where 
the in addition to the common intercept each individual/group has their own 
intercept with zero-mean normal prior and unknown standard deviation 
(or multivariate gaussian in case argument `correlated = TRUE`),
analogously with the typical mixed models. Note however, that currently random 
intercepts are not supported for categorical distribution due to technical 
reasons.

## Auxiliary channels

In addition to declaring response variables via `obs`, we can also use the 
function `aux` to define auxiliary channels which are deterministic functions 
of other variables. 
Defining these auxiliary variables explicitly instead of defining 
them implicitly on the right-hand side of the formulas (i.e., by using the 
"as is" function `I()`) makes the subsequent prediction steps more clear and 
allows easier checks on the model validity. In fact, we do not allow the use 
of `I()` within `dynamiteformula`. The values of auxiliary variables are 
computed dynamically during prediction, making the use of lagged values and 
other transformations possible. An example of a formula using an auxiliary 
channel could be 

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
obs(y ~ lag(log1x), family = "gaussian") + 
obs(x ~ z, family = "poisson") +
aux(numeric(log1x) ~ log(1 + x) | init(0))
``` 

For auxiliary channels, the formula declaration `~` should be understood as a 
mathematical equality, where the right hand side provides the defining 
expression. Thus the example above defines a new auxiliary channel 
whose response is `log1x` defined as the logarithm of `1 + x` and assigns it to 
be of type `numeric`. The type declaration is required, because it might not be
possible to unambiguously determine the type of the response variable
based on its expression alone from the data, especially for `factor` responses.

Auxiliary variables can be used directly in the formulas of other channels, 
just like any other variable. Note that an auxiliary channel can also depend on 
other response variables without lags, unlike observed channels.
The function `aux` also does not use the `family` argument, which is 
automatically set to `deterministic` and is a special channel type of `obs`. 
Note that lagged values of deterministic `aux` channels do not imply fixed time 
points. Instead they must be given starting values using one of the two special
functions, `init` or `past` after the main formula separated by 
the `|` symbol.

In the example above, because the channel for `y` contains a lagged value of 
`log1x` as a predictor, we also need to supply `log1x` with a single initial 
value that determines the value of the lag at the first time point. 
Here, `init(0)` defines the initial value of `lag(log1x)` 
to be zero. In general, if the model contains higher order lags of an 
auxiliary channel, then `init` can be supplied with a vector 
initializing each lag.

Note that `init` defines the same starting value to be used for all
individuals. As an alternative, the function `past` can be used, which
takes an R expression as its argument, and computes the starting value for
each individual based on that expression. The expression is evaluated in the
context of the `data` supplied to `dynamite`. For example, instead of `init(0)` 
in the example above, we could write:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
obs(y ~ lag(log1x), family = "gaussian") + 
obs(x ~ z, family = "poisson") +
aux(numeric(log1x) ~ log(1 + x) | past(log(z)))
``` 

which defines that the value of `lag(log1x)` at the first time point is 
`log(z)` for each individual, using the value of `z` in the data to
be supplied to compute the actual value of the expression. The function `past` 
can also be used if the model contains higher order lags of auxiliary 
responses. In this case, more observations from the variables bound by the 
expression given as the argument will simply be used.

## Fitting the Model

The declared model formula is supplied to `dynamite`, which has the following 
arguments and default values:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
dynamite(dformula, data, group = NULL, time, priors = NULL, verbose = TRUE, 
  debug = NULL, ...)

```

The first argument `dformula` is the `dynamiteformula` object that defines the 
model and the second argument `data` is a `data.frame` that contains the 
variables used in the model formula. The argument `group` is a column name of 
`data` that specified the unique groups (individuals) and similarly, `time` is 
a column name of `data` that specifies the unique time points. Note that 
`group` is optional: when `group = NULL` we assume that there is only a single 
group (or individual). The argument `priors` supplies optional user-defined 
priors for the model parameters, and `...` supplies additional arguments to 
`rstan::sampling` which handles the model estimation. Finally, `verbose` 
controls the verbosity of the output and `debug` can be used for various 
debugging options (see `?dynamite` for further information on 
these parameters). For example, 

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
dynamite(
  dformula = obs(x ~ varying(~ -1 + w), family = "poisson") + splines(df = 10), 
  data = d, 
  group = "id"
  time = "year", 
  chains = 2, 
  cores = 2
)
``` 

estimates the model using the data in the data frame `d`, which contains 
variables `year` and `id` (defining the time-index and group-index variables 
of the data). Arguments `chains` and `cores` are passed to `rstan::sampling` 
which then uses to parallel Markov chains in the the Markov chain Monte Carlo 
(MCMC) sampling of the model parameters.

# Example of Multichannel Model

As an example, consider the following simulated multichannel data:

```{r}
library(dynamite)
head(multichannel_example)
```

The data contains 50 unique groups (variable `id`), over 20 time points 
(`time`), a continuous variable `g`, a variable with non-negative integer 
values `p`, and a binary variable `b`. We define the following model 
(which actually matches the data generating process used in 
simulating the data):

```{r}
set.seed(1)
f <- obs(g ~ lag(g) + lag(logp), family = "gaussian") +
  obs(p ~ lag(g) + lag(logp) + lag(b), family = "poisson") +
  obs(b ~ lag(b) * lag(logp) + lag(b) * lag(g), family = "bernoulli") +
  aux(numeric(logp) ~ log(p + 1))
```
As a directed acyclic graph (DAG), the model for the first three time points is 
![A DAG of the multichannel model.](dag.png){width=80%}

(The deterministic channel `logp` is omitted for clarity).

We fit the model using the `dynamite` function. In order to satisfy the package 
size requirements of CRAN, we have to use small number of 
iterations and additional thinning:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
multichannel_example_fit <- dynamite(
  f, multichannel_example, "id", "time",
  chains = 1, cores = 1, iter = 2000, warmup = 1000, init = 0, refresh = 0,
  thin = 5, save_warmup = FALSE)
```

You can update the estimated model which is 
included in the package as 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
multichannel_example_fit <- update(multichannel_example_fit,
    iter = 2000,
    warmup = 1000,
    chains = 4,
    cores = 4,
    refresh = 0,
    save_warmup = FALSE
)
```

Note that the `dynamite` call above produces a warning message related to the 
deterministic channel `logp`:

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
fit <- dynamite(f, multichannel_example, "id", "time", 
                debug = list(no_compile = TRUE))
```

This happens because the formulas of the other channels have `lag(logp)` as a 
predictor, whose value is undefined at the first time point without the initial 
value. However, in this case we can safely ignore the warning because the 
model contains lags of `b` and `g` as well meaning that the
first time point in the model is fixed and does not enter into the model 
fitting process.

We can obtain posterior samples or summary statistics of the model using the 
`as.data.frame`, `coef`, and `summary` functions, but here we opt for 
visualizing the results using the `plot_betas` function:

```{r}
plot_betas(multichannel_example_fit)
```

Note the naming of the model parameters; for example `beta_b_g_lag1` 
corresponds to a fixed coefficient `beta` of lagged variable `g` 
of the channel `b`.

Assume now that we are interested in studying the causal effect of variable 
$b_5$ on variable $g_t$ at $t = 6, \ldots, 20$. There is no direct effect from 
$b_5$ to $g_6$, but as $g_t$ at affects $b_{t+1}$ (and $p_{t+1}$), which in 
turn has an effect on all the variables at $t+2$, we should see an indirect 
effect of $b_5$ to $g_t$ from time $t=7$ onward.

For this task, we first create a new dataset where the values of our 
response variables after time 5 are set to NA:

```{r}
d <- multichannel_example
d <- d |> 
  dplyr::mutate(
    g = ifelse(time > 5, NA, g),
    p = ifelse(time > 5, NA, p),
    b = ifelse(time > 5, NA, b))
```

We then predict time points 6 to 20 when $b$ at time 5 is 0 or 1 for everyone:

```{r}
newdata0 <- d |> 
  dplyr::mutate(
    b = ifelse(time == 5, 0, b))
pred0 <- predict(multichannel_example_fit, newdata = newdata0, type = "mean")
newdata1 <- d |> 
  dplyr::mutate(
    b = ifelse(time == 5, 1, b))
pred1 <- predict(multichannel_example_fit, newdata = newdata1, type = "mean")
```

By default, the output from `predict` is a single data frame containing the 
original new data and the samples from the posterior predictive distribution new observations. By defining `type = "mean"` we specify that we are interested in the posterior distribution of the expected values instead. 
In this case the the predicted values in a data frame are in the columns `g_mean`, `p_mean`, and `b_mean` where the NA values of `newdata` are replaced with the posterior samples from the model (the output also contains additional column corresponding to the auxiliary channel `logp` and index variable `.draw`). For more memory efficient format, by using argument `expand = FALSE` the output is 
returned as a `list` with two components, `simulated` and `observed`, with 
new samples and original `newdata` respectively.

```{r}
head(pred0, n = 10) # first rows are NA as those were treated as fixed
```

We can now compute summary statistics over the individuals and then over the 
posterior samples to obtain posterior distribution of the causal effects as

```{r}
sumr <- dplyr::bind_rows(
  list(b0 = pred0, b1 = pred1), .id = "case") |> 
  dplyr::group_by(case, .draw, time) |> 
  dplyr::summarise(mean_t = mean(g_mean)) |> 
  dplyr::group_by(case, time) |> 
  dplyr::summarise(
    mean = mean(mean_t),
    q5 = quantile(mean_t, 0.05, na.rm = TRUE), 
    q95 = quantile(mean_t, 0.95, na.rm = TRUE))
```

It is also possible to do the marginalization over groups inside `predict` by using the argument `funs` which can be used to provide a named list of lists which contains functions to be applied for the corresponding channel. This approach can save considerably amount of memory in case of large number of groups. The names of the outermost list should be either channel names with or without suffix `_mean` depending on whether the functions should be applied to response or mean. In our case we can write
```{r, eval = FALSE}
pred0b <- predict(multichannel_example_fit, newdata = newdata0, type = "mean", 
  funs = list(g_mean = list(mean_t = mean)))$simulated
pred1b <- predict(multichannel_example_fit, newdata = newdata1, type = "mean", 
  funs = list(g_mean = list(mean_t = mean)))$simulated
sumrb <- dplyr::bind_rows(
  list(b0 = pred0b, b1 = pred1b), .id = "case") |> 
  dplyr::group_by(case, time) |> 
  dplyr::summarise(
    mean = mean(mean_t_g_mean),
    q5 = quantile(mean_t_g_mean, 0.05, na.rm = TRUE), 
    q95 = quantile(mean_t_g_mean, 0.95, na.rm = TRUE))
```
The resulting tibble `sumrb` is equal to the previous `sumr` (apart from randomness due to simulation of new trajectories).

We can the visualize our predictions with the `ggplot2` [@ggplot2] as

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(sumr, aes(time, mean)) + 
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = q5, ymax = q95), alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_line() + 
  scale_x_continuous(n.breaks = 10) + 
  facet_wrap(~ case) +
  theme_bw()
```

Note that these estimates do indeed coincide with the causal effects (assuming 
of course that our model is correct), as we can find the backdoor adjustment 
formula [@Pearl1995]
\[
  E(g_t | do(b_5 = x)) = \sum_{g_5, p_5}E(g_t | b_5 = x, g_5, p_5) P(g_5, p_5), 
\]
which is equal to `mean_t` in above codes.

We can also compute the difference
$P(g_t | do(b_5 = 1)) - P(g_t | do(b_5 = 0))$ as
```{r}
sumr_diff <- dplyr::bind_rows(
  list(b0 = pred0, b1 = pred1), .id = "case") |> 
  dplyr::group_by(.draw, time) |>
  dplyr::summarise(
    mean_t = mean(g_mean[case == "b1"] - g_mean[case == "b0"])) |>
  dplyr::group_by(time) |>
  dplyr::summarise(
    mean = mean(mean_t),
    q5 = quantile(mean_t, 0.05, na.rm = TRUE),
    q95 = quantile(mean_t, 0.95, na.rm = TRUE))

Which shows that there is a short term effect of $b$ on $g$, although the 
posterior uncertainty is quite large. Note that for multistep causal effects 
these estimates contain also Monte Carlo variation due to the simulation of 
the trajectories (e.g., there is also uncertainty in `mean_t` for fixed 
parameters given finite number of individuals we are marginalizing over).
